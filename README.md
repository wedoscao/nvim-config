# Neovim Configuration

This repository contains my **Neovim configuration**, built for speed, modern development, and productivity.  
It uses [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) for configuration and leverages the power of [Neovim 0.9+](https://neovim.io/) features.

**Clone this repo into your Neovim config directory**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wedoscao/nvim-config ~/.config/nvim
